# pacman_game
Pacman is a timeless arcade game that was and is still enjoyed by many people. The purpose of this project is to learn how to build this pacman game using Python. I will be using various sources to help in building this game. One useful source is from https://github.com/greyblue9/pacman-python.
This project requires you to install arcade and pygame using the pip command.
